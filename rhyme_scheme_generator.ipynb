    "# **Poetry Rhyme Scheme Calculator**\n",
    "### Intro to Computational Linguistics Final Project\n",
    "#### By: Cade Edney\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Summary:**\n",
    "While it may be easy to see a rhyme scheme from just reading it, we can also easily do so through code. This project utilizes the Gutenberg Corpus to get popular poems, and Carnegie Mellon University's Pronunciation Dictionary, to determine the rhyme scheme of the chosen poem. To do so:\n",
    "1. The poem chosen is broken up stanza-by-stanza. \n",
    "2. Each stanza is then broken up line-by-line and we look at the stress tail in the line.\n",
    "    * The stress tail is the final place with the greatest stress, then the remaining syllables after.\n",
    "3. Each syllable that are the same or calculated to be a slant rhyme in the stanza are defined with the same letter.\n",
    "    * As slant rhymes are somewhat subjective, it's hard to determine a black-and-white answer for if two words *may* rhyme or not. So, I have researched and found a source that helps:\n",
    "    * The slant rhymes are detected by using weights provided by the paper \"Dynamically Scoring Rhymes with Phonetic Features and Sequence Alignment\", cited below.\n",
    "4. Once the code is done determining each stanza's rhyme scheme in this manner, it determines the most used rhyme scheme using a Counter object.\n",
